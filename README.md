## 🧑‍💻 **How It Works**

### 1. **Data Preparation**
   - Load the **Salary Dataset** using **Pandas**.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and formatting inconsistencies.
   - Split the dataset into **training** and **test** sets using **Scikit-Learn**.

### 2. **Model Training**
   - Implement **Simple Linear Regression** using Scikit-Learn’s `LinearRegression` class.
   - Train the model on the training data (`Years of Experience` vs. `Salary`).

### 3. **Prediction**
   - Test the model on unseen data and predict salaries for given years of experience.

### 4. **Visualization**
   - Plot the regression line and data points in Python using **Matplotlib**.
   - Generate additional visualizations using R for a deeper understanding.

### 5. **Evaluation**
   - Assess the model’s performance using metrics like **MSE** and **R-squared**.
   - Analyze residuals to validate the accuracy of the predictions.
